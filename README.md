# 4-Axis-Robotic-Arm
This project is a 4 Axis robotic Arm. The joints are controlled using a 4 servo motors and an Arduino Nano 33 IOT is used to control the project and allows me to control the arm using the Arduino IOT cloud dashboard from my phone.

The arm was originaly supposed to be a 6 axis robotix arm but due to lack of materials i had to make the arm using cardboard. The structure would collapse if any more was added. I am currently working on getting new parts and making an more stronger version of the arm that will include 6 Axis.
 
The arm currently only has a shoulder elbow and forearm(grip and wrist to be added).

# How it works
1. set up a dashboard with 4 sliders on the IOT cloud website to control each motor
2. create 4 varaible and assign them to sliders
3. upload arm.ino to arduino
4. control the arm using dashboard

# Materials 
1. 4 S51 servo motors
2. Arduino Nano 33 IOT
3. cardboard
4. 5V 3A power supply

# How it looks
